## AnkiDroid-MIA Manual

The additional options from this program are under the "Mass Immersion Approach" settings screen:

### Sticky Languages (v1.0.1) pending in AnkiDroid.

* Requires Android Nougat or higher; GBoard, or compatible keyboard
* The context (long press) menu for fields in the note editor now allows language selection. The keybaord will then automatically switch to the field when edited.
* This dialog can also be accessed via the 'Manage Note Types' screen. This is useful in the case of Xiaomi phones where developers can't customize the context menu. 

### Pass/Fail (v1.0.0)

* Removes the Hard and Easy buttons, keeping only Again (Fail), and Good (Pass)
* Remaps the '2' key to answer "Pass"

### No Boosting/Penalties (v1.0.0)

* Keeps the Ease Factor of a card at a constant 250%, resetting it each time it is displayed.
